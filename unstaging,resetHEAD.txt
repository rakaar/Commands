prequisite:HEAD:a HEAD is the most recent commit


suppose u have added some files to the staging area.
you want to unstage them (remove from the staging area)

git reset HEAD <file name if any>

suppose 
there is a project a ,which changes as follows:
a->b->c
a,b,c are committed.
c is undesired but it is the last commit. it would really be nice,if u 
could go back to 'b'. but git doesnot allow that.
what  u can do is again commit 'b'
for that
git log
copy the first 7 digits of commit 'b'
use 

git reset <the first 7 digits of 'b' commit>

this allows u to change the HEAD..
the scenario is something like a->b->c->b
