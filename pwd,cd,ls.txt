pwd :- this means the print working directory

cd  :- this means change the current directory

cd <dir1> :- this means change the current directory to dir1

Suppose your pwd  is something like c/user/Raghavendra Kaushik/Desktop/hello
And you want your pwd to change to  c/user/Raghavendra Kaushik/Desktop. 
In simple words u want to move from hello directory to Desktop directory.
or u can just type cd and then pull the folder towards terminal to which you want to change your directory
To generalize move one directory backward
USE:-   cd ..

cd:- You will get back to home directory

ls :- to list the contents of the directory

ls -la :- to list ALL the contents including the secret files like .git file.
