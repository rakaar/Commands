  GIT STATUS:
after init,before add : it tells u 'untrackd files.' git sees it but has not started tracking

after add,before commit : it tells u that changes need to be commited,it is currently in the staging area

after commit : it tells u - on master branch nothing to commit ,working tree clean.

 SUPPOSE U MADE CHANGES AFTER A COMMIT..
.. ..//this is a silly point, but just wrote it
and u  want to remove them , that's the same as adding the file to the staging area using git add command and then 
commiting it
